bugs:
1.  Transitioned collapsing menu height doesn't comply with extra projects above the height limit.  Easy solution is to roll back to none transition option
2.  Same name projects breaks the project selection
3.  Task editing not wide enough in mobile aspect
4.  Empty space at the start or the end of the string makes the project non-selectable.  Need to implement trim to remove leading or trailing empty space
